Using conda environment the most of tools and packages required for any computational biology analyses can be installed. The minimal version of conda can be installed by Linux terminal are given below:

    cd Downloads/
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
