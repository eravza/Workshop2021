# SCB RSG-Turkey Student Symposium – 12.09.2021
## Data Manipulation Workshop (Instructor Sevilay Güleşen)

All sessions of the workshop will be held in Linux environment. For Command Line
Basics and Data Manipulation sessions, “Bash” will be used as a SHELL type. In
general, all commands are common to every SHELL but sometimes some may differ.
Different SHELL types will not be a problem for our workshop, you might probably get
errors for just a few commands. You can check your SHELL type with the following command:

    echo $SHELL

We will analyze the [pdbInfo.txt](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/rsgturkey/Workshop2021/blob/main/Data_Manipulation/toy_data/pdbInfo.txt) data file by using bash commands in the workshop.

You can download the **pdbInfo.txt** file from **"toy_data" folder** to be ready for the Data Manipulation Workshop.
